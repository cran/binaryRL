\arguments{
\item{policy}{[string]

Specifies the learning policy to be used.
This determines how the model updates action values based on observed or
  simulated choices. It can be either \code{"off"} or \code{"on"}.
  
 \itemize{
  \item {
   \strong{Off-Policy (Q-learning): }
   This is the most common approach for modeling
    reinforcement learning in Two-Alternative Forced Choice (TAFC) tasks.
    In this mode, the model's goal is to learn the underlying value of
    each option by observing the human participant's behavior. It achieves
    this by consistently updating the value of the option that the
    human actually chose. The focus is on understanding the value 
    representation that likely drove the participant's decisions.
  }
  \item {
   \strong{Off-Policy (SARSA): }
   In this mode, the target policy and the behavior policy are identical. 
    The model first computes the selection probability for each option based 
    on their current values. Critically, it then uses these probabilities to 
    sample its own action. The value update is then performed on the action 
    that the model itself selected. This approach focuses more on directly 
    mimicking the stochastic choice patterns of the agent, rather than just 
    learning the underlying values from a fixed sequence of actions.
  }
 }
 
default: \code{policy = "off"}}

\item{data}{[data.frame] 

This data should include the following mandatory columns: 
 \itemize{
   \item \code{sub} "Subject"
   \item \code{time_line} "Block" "Trial"
   \item \code{L_choice} "L_choice"
   \item \code{R_choice} "R_choice"
   \item \code{L_reward} "L_reward"
   \item \code{R_reward} "R_reward"
   \item \code{sub_choose} "Sub_Choose"
 }}

\item{id}{[CharacterVector]

Specifies which subject's data to use. In parameter and model recovery
 analyses, the specific subject ID is often irrelevant. Although the
 experimental trial order might have some randomness for each subject,
 the sequence of reward feedback is typically pseudo-random.

The default value for this argument is \code{NULL}. When \code{id = NULL},
 the program automatically detects existing subject IDs within the
 dataset. It then randomly selects one subject as a sample, and the
 parameter and model recovery procedures are performed based on this
 selected subject's data.
 
default: \code{id = NULL}}

\item{n_trials}{[integer]

Represents the total number of trials a single subject experienced
 in the experiment. If this parameter is kept at its default value
 of \code{NULL}, the program will automatically detect how many trials
 a subject experienced from the provided data. This information
 is primarily used for calculating model fit statistics such as
 AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information
 Criterion).
 
 default: \code{n_trials = NULL}}

\item{funcs}{[CharacterVector]

A character vector containing the names of all user-defined functions
 required for the computation. When parallel computation is enabled
 (i.e., \code{nc > 1}), user-defined models and their custom functions 
 might not be automatically accessible within the parallel environment.

Therefore, if you have created your own reinforcement learning model
 that modifies the package's default six default functions 
 (default functions: 
    \code{util_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_gamma}}, 
    \code{rate_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_eta}}, 
    \code{expl_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_epsilon}},
    \code{bias_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_pi}},
    \code{prob_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_tau}},
    \code{loss_func = \link[binaryRL]{func_logl}}
 ), 
 you must explicitly provide the names of your custom functions as a 
 vector here.}

\item{model_names}{[List] 

The names of fit modals

e.g. \code{model_names = c("TD", "RSTD", "Utility")}}

\item{simulate_models}{[List] 

A collection of functions used to generate simulated data.}

\item{simulate_lower}{[List] 

The lower bounds for simulate models

e.g. \code{simulate_lower = list(c(0, 0), c(0, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 0))}}

\item{simulate_upper}{[List] 
The upper bounds for simulate models

e.g. \code{simulate_upper = list(c(1, 1), c(1, 1, 1), c(1, 1, 1))}}

\item{fit_models}{[List] 

A collection of functions applied to fit models to the data.

e.g. \code{fit_models = list(binaryRL::TD, binaryRL::RSTD, binaryRL::Utility)}}

\item{fit_lower}{[List] 

The lower bounds for model fit models

e.g. \code{fit_lower = list(c(0, 0), c(0, 0, 0), c(0, 0, 0))}}

\item{fit_upper}{[List] 

The upper bounds for model fit models

e.g. \code{fit_upper = list(c(1, 1), c(1, 1, 1), c(1, 1, 10))}}

\item{iteration_s}{[integer]

This parameter determines how many simulated datasets are created for 
 subsequent model and parameter recovery analyses.
 
default: \code{iteration_s = 10}}

\item{iteration_f}{[integer]

The number of iterations the optimization algorithm will perform
 when searching for the best-fitting parameters during the fitting
 phase. A higher number of iterations may increase the likelihood of 
 finding a global optimum but also increases computation time.
 
default: \code{iteration_f = 10}}

\item{initial_params}{[NumericVector]

Initial values for the free parameters that the optimization algorithm will
 search from. These are primarily relevant when using algorithms that require
 an explicit starting point, such as \code{L-BFGS-B}. If not specified,
 the function will automatically generate initial values close to zero.
 
 default: \code{initial_params = NA}.}

\item{initial_size}{[integer]

This parameter corresponds to the population size in genetic 
 algorithms (\code{GA}). It specifies the number of initial candidate
 solutions that the algorithm starts with for its evolutionary search.
 This parameter is only required for optimization algorithms that operate on
 a population, such as \code{GA} or \code{DEoptim}. 
 
 default: \code{initial_size = 50}.}

\item{seed}{[integer] 

Random seed. This ensures that the results are 
 reproducible and remain the same each time the function is run. 
 
 default: \code{seed = 123}}

\item{nc}{[integer]

Number of cores to use for parallel processing. Since fitting
optimal parameters for each subject is an independent task,
parallel computation can significantly speed up the fitting process:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{nc = 1}: The fitting proceeds sequentially.
  Parameters for one subject are fitted completely before moving
  to the next subject.
  \item \strong{nc > 1}: The fitting is performed in parallel
  across subjects. For example, if \code{nc = 4}, the algorithm will
  simultaneously fit data for four subjects. Once these are complete,
  it will proceed to fit the next batch of subjects (e.g., subjects
  5-8), and so on, until all subjects are processed.
}

 \code{default: nc = 1}}

\item{algorithm}{[string] 

Choose an algorithm package from
 \code{L-BFGS-B}, \code{GenSA},\code{GA},\code{DEoptim},\code{PSO},
 \code{Bayesian}, \code{CMA-ES}.
 
In addition, any algorithm from the \code{nloptr} package is also
 supported. If your chosen \code{nloptr} algorithm requires a local search,
 you need to input a character vector. The first element represents
 the algorithm used for global search, and the second element represents
 the algorithm used for local search.}
}
\value{
A list where each element is a data.frame. 
 Each data.frame within this list records the results of fitting synthetic 
 data (generated by Model A) with Model B.
}
\description{
This function is designed for model and parameter recovery of user-created
 (black-box) models, provided they conform to the specified interface.
 (demo:  
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{TD}}, 
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{RSTD}}, 
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{Utility}}
 ).
The process involves generating synthetic datasets. First, parameters
 are randomly sampled within a defined range. These parameters are then
 used to simulate artificial datasets.

Subsequently, all candidate models are used to fit these simulated
 datasets. Model recoverability is assessed if a synthetic dataset
 generated by Model A is consistently best fitted by Model A itself.

Furthermore, the function allows users to evaluate parameter
 recoverability. If, for instance, a synthetic dataset generated by
 Model A was based on parameters like 0.3 and 0.7, and Model A then
 recovers optimal parameters close to 0.3 and 0.7 from this data,
 it indicates that the parameters of Model A are recoverable.
 
 The function provides several optimization algorithms:
  \itemize{
    \item 1. L-BFGS-B (from \code{stats::optim})
    \item 2. Simulated Annealing (\code{GenSA::GenSA})
    \item 3. Genetic Algorithm (\code{GA::ga})
    \item 4. Differential Evolution (\code{DEoptim::DEoptim})
    \item 5. Particle Swarm Optimization (\code{pso::psoptim})
    \item 6. Bayesian Optimization (\code{mlrMBO::mbo})
    \item 7. Covariance Matrix Adapting Evolutionary Strategy (\code{cmaes::cma_es})
    \item 8. Nonlinear Optimization (\code{nloptr::nloptr})
  }

}
\note{
While both \code{fit_p} and \code{rcv_d} utilize the same underlying
\code{optimize_para} function to find optimal parameters, they play
distinct and sequential roles in the modeling pipeline.

The key differences are as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item{\strong{Purpose and Data Source}: \code{rcv_d} should always be
    performed before \code{fit_p}. Its primary role is to validate a
    model's stability by fitting it to synthetic data generated by the
    model itself. This process, known as parameter recovery, ensures the
    model is well-behaved. In contrast, \code{fit_p} is used in the
    subsequent stage to fit the validated model to real experimental
    data.}

  \item{\strong{Estimation Method}: \code{rcv_d} does not include an
    \code{estimate} argument. This is because the synthetic data is
    generated from known "true" parameters, which are drawn from
    pre-defined distributions (typically uniform for most parameters and
    exponential for the inverse temperature). Since the ground truth is
    known, a hierarchical estimation (MAP) is not applicable. The
    \code{fit_p} function, however, requires this argument to handle
    real data where the true parameters are unknown.}

  \item{\strong{Policy Setting}: In \code{fit_p}, the \code{policy}
    setting has different effects: "on-policy" is better for learning
    choice patterns, while "off-policy" yields more accurate parameter
    estimates. For \code{rcv_d}, the process defaults to an "off-policy"
    approach because its main objectives are to verify if the true
    parameters can be accurately recovered and to assess whether competing
    models are distinguishable, tasks for which off-policy estimation is
    more suitable.}
