\arguments{
\item{i}{The current row number.}

\item{L_freq}{The frequency of left option appearance}

\item{R_freq}{The frequency of right option appearance}

\item{L_pick}{The number of times left option was picked}

\item{R_pick}{The number of times left option was picked}

\item{L_value}{The value of the left option}

\item{R_value}{The value of the right option}

\item{var1}{[character] 
Column name of extra variable 1. If your model uses more than just reward 
 and expected value, and you need other information, such as whether the 
 choice frame is Gain or Loss, then you can input the 'Frame' column as 
 var1 into the model.
 
 \code{default: var1 = "Extra_Var1"}}

\item{var2}{[character] 
Column name of extra variable 2. If one additional variable, var1, does not 
 meet your needs, you can add another additional variable, var2, into your 
 model.
 
 \code{default: var2 = "Extra_Var2"}}

\item{value}{The expected value of the stimulus in the subject's mind at this point in time.}

\item{utility}{The subjective value that the subject assigns to the objective reward.}

\item{reward}{The objective reward received by the subject after selecting a stimulus.}

\item{occurrence}{The number of times the same stimulus has been chosen.}

\item{gamma}{[vector]
This parameter represents the exponent in utility functions, specifically:
 \itemize{
   \item \strong{Stevens' Power Law}:
   Utility is modeled as:
   \deqn{U(R) = {R}^{\gamma}}

   \item \strong{Kahneman's Prospect Theory}:
   This exponent is applied differently based on the sign of the reward:
   \deqn{U(R) = \begin{cases}
     R^{\gamma_{1}}, & R > 0 \\
     \beta \cdot R^{\gamma_{2}}, & R < 0
   \end{cases}}
 }}

\item{alpha}{[vector]
Extra parameters that may be used in functions.}

\item{beta}{[vector]
Extra parameters that may be used in functions.}
}
\value{
Discount rate and utility
}
\description{
This function represents an exponent used in calculating utility
from reward. Its application varies depending on the specific model:
 \itemize{
   \item \strong{Stevens' Power Law}:
   Here, utility is calculated by raising the reward to the power
   of \code{gamma}. This describes how the subjective value (utility) of a
   reward changes non-linearly with its objective magnitude.

   \item \strong{Kahneman's Prospect Theory}:
   This theory applies exponents differently for gains and losses,
   and introduces a loss aversion coefficient:
   \itemize{
     \item For positive rewards (gains), utility is the reward
     raised to the power of \code{gamma[1]}.
     \item For negative rewards (losses), utility is calculated
     by first multiplying the reward by \code{beta}, and then raising
     this product to the power of \code{gamma[2]}. Here, \code{beta} acts 
     as a loss aversion parameter, accounting for the greater psychological 
     impact of losses compared to equivalent gains.

\note{
When customizing these functions, please ensure that you do not modify 
 the arguments. Instead, only modify the `if-else` statements or the internal 
 logic to adapt the function to your needs.
