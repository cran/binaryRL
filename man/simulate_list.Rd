  data,

}
\arguments{
\item{data}{[data.frame] 

This data should include the following mandatory columns: 
 \itemize{
   \item "sub"
   \item "time_line" (e.g., "Block", "Trial")
   \item "L_choice"
   \item "R_choice"
   \item "L_reward"
   \item "R_reward"
   \item "sub_choose"
 }}

\item{id}{[vector]

Specifies which subject's data to use. In parameter and model recovery
 analyses, the specific subject ID is often irrelevant. Although the
 experimental trial order might have some randomness for each subject,
 the sequence of reward feedback is typically pseudo-random.

The default value for this argument is \code{NULL}. When \code{id = NULL},
 the program automatically detects existing subject IDs within the
 dataset. It then randomly selects one subject as a sample, and the
 parameter and model recovery procedures are performed based on this
 selected subject's data.
 
default: \code{id = NULL}}

\item{obj_func}{[function]

The objective function that the optimization algorithm package accepts.
 This function must strictly take only one argument, \code{params} (a vector
 of model parameters). Its output must be a single numeric value
 representing the loss function to be minimized. For more detailed
 requirements and examples, please refer to the relevant documentation 
 (
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{TD}}, 
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{RSTD}}, 
    \code{\link[binaryRL]{Utility}}
 ).}

\item{n_params}{[integer] 

The number of free parameters in your model.}

\item{n_trials}{[integer] 

The total number of trials in your experiment.}

\item{lower}{[vector] 

Lower bounds of free parameters}

\item{upper}{[vector] 

Upper bounds of free parameters}

\item{iteration}{[integer]

This parameter determines how many simulated datasets are created for 
 subsequent model and parameter recovery analyses.}

\item{seed}{[integer] 

Random seed. This ensures that the results are 
 reproducible and remain the same each time the function is run. 
 
default: \code{seed = 123}}
}
\value{
a list with fake data generated by random free parameters
}
\description{
This function is responsible for generating synthetic (fake) data
 using random numbers. For all parameters except the last one, their
 values are drawn from a uniform distribution within their respective
 specified ranges.

The last parameter, representing the temperature (\code{tau}) in the soft-max
 function, is drawn from an exponential distribution. If its \code{upper} bound
 is set to 1, it implies \code{tau} is sampled from \code{Exp(1)} (an exponential
 distribution with a rate parameter of 1). If its \code{lower} bound is set
 to 1, this means that after \code{tau} is randomly generated, it is shifted
 to the right by adding 1 (i.e., \code{tau+1}), establishing a minimum value.
