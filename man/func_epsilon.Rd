\arguments{
\item{i}{The current row number.}

\item{L_freq}{The frequency of left option appearance}

\item{R_freq}{The frequency of right option appearance}

\item{L_pick}{The number of times left option was picked}

\item{R_pick}{The number of times left option was picked}

\item{L_value}{The value of the left option}

\item{R_value}{The value of the right option}

\item{var1}{[character] 
Column name of extra variable 1. If your model uses more than just reward 
 and expected value, and you need other information, such as whether the 
 choice frame is Gain or Loss, then you can input the 'Frame' column as 
 var1 into the model.
 
 \code{default: var1 = "Extra_Var1"}}

\item{var2}{[character] 
Column name of extra variable 2. If one additional variable, var1, does not 
 meet your needs, you can add another additional variable, var2, into your 
 model.
 
 \code{default: var2 = "Extra_Var2"}}

\item{threshold}{[integer]
Controls the initial exploration phase in the \strong{epsilon-first} strategy.
 This is the number of early trials where the subject makes purely random
 choices, as they haven't yet learned the options' values. For example,
 \code{threshold = 20} means random choices for the first 20 trials.
 For \strong{epsilon-greedy} or \strong{epsilon-decreasing} strategies,
 `threshold` should be kept at its default value.
 
 \deqn{
 P(x) = 
 \begin{cases}
   \text{trial} \le \text{threshold}, & x=1 \text{ (random choosing)} \\
   \text{trial} > \text{threshold}, & x=0 \text{ (value-based choosing)}
 \end{cases}
 }
 
 \code{default: threshold = 1}
 
 \code{epsilon-first: threshold = 20, epsilon = NA, lambda = NA}}

\item{epsilon}{[numeric]
A parameter used in the \strong{epsilon-greedy} exploration strategy. It 
 defines the probability of making a completely random choice, as opposed 
 to choosing based on the relative values of the left and right options. 
 For example, if `epsilon = 0.1`, the subject has a 10% chance of random 
 choice and a 90% chance of value-based choice. This parameter is only 
 relevant when `threshold` is at its default value (1) and `lambda` is not 
 set.
 
 \deqn{P(x) = \begin{cases}
   \epsilon, & x=1 \text{ (random choosing)} \\
   1-\epsilon, & x=0 \text{ (value-based choosing)}
 \end{cases}}

 \code{epsilon-greedy: threshold = 1, epsilon = 0.1, lambda = NA}}

\item{lambda}{[vector] 
A numeric value that controls the decay rate of exploration probability
 in the \strong{epsilon-decreasing} strategy. A higher `lambda` value
 means the probability of random choice will decrease more rapidly
 as the number of trials increases.
 
 \deqn{
 P(x) = 
 \begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{1+\lambda \cdot trial}, & x=1 \text{ (random choosing)} \\
   \frac{\lambda \cdot trial}{1+\lambda \cdot trial}, & x=0 \text{ (value-based choosing)}
 \end{cases}
 }
 
 \code{epsilon-decreasing threshold = 1, epsilon = NA, lambda = 0.5}}

\item{alpha}{[vector]
Extra parameters that may be used in functions.}

\item{beta}{[vector]
Extra parameters that may be used in functions.}
}
\value{
A numeric value, either 0 or 1. 0 indicates no exploration (choice based 
 on value), and 1 indicates exploration (random choice) for that trial.
}
\description{
The exploration strategy parameters are 
 \code{threshold}, \code{epsilon}, and \code{lambda}.

  \itemize{
    \item \strong{Epsilon-first strategy:} Used when only \code{threshold} is set. 
      Subjects choose randomly for trials less than \code{threshold} and by value 
      for trials greater than `\code{threshold}.
    \item \strong{Epsilon-greedy strategy:} Used if \code{threshold} is default 
      (1) and \code{epsilon} is set. Subjects explore with probability 
      \code{epsilon} throughout the experiment.
    \item \strong{Epsilon-decreasing strategy:} Used if \code{threshold} is 
      default (1), and \code{lambda} is set. In this strategy, the probability of 
      random choice (exploration) decreases as trials increase. The 
      parameter \code{lambda} controls the rate at which this probability 
      declines with each trial.

\note{
When customizing these functions, please ensure that you do not modify 
 the arguments. Instead, only modify the `if-else` statements or the internal 
 logic to adapt the function to your needs.
