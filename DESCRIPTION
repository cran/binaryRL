Title: Reinforcement Learning Tools for Two-Alternative Forced Choice
        Tasks
Description: Tools for building Rescorla-Wagner Models for Two-Alternative 
  Forced Choice tasks, commonly employed in psychological research. 
  Most concepts and ideas within this R package are referenced from 
  Sutton and Barto (2018) <ISBN:9780262039246>. 
  The package allows for the intuitive definition of RL models using simple 
  if-else statements and three basic models built into this R package are 
  referenced from 
  Niv et al. (2012)<doi:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5498-10.2012>. 
  Our approach to constructing and evaluating these computational models 
  is informed by the guidelines proposed in 
  Wilson & Collins (2019) <doi:10.7554/eLife.49547>. 
  Example datasets included with the package are sourced from the work of
  Mason et al. (2024) <doi:10.3758/s13423-023-02415-x>.
