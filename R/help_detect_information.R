#' Detect Subject Information from Data
#'
#' @description
#' Analyzes a dataframe to extract subject-related information.
#'  It auto-detects a subject ID column (looking for names containing "sub"),
#'  then determines:
#'  1. The name of this subject ID column.
#'  2. The number of rows (trials) for one randomly selected subject.
#'  3. The ID of this randomly selected subject (coerced to numeric).
#'  4. A vector of all unique subject IDs found in the column.
#' The function provides messages about its progress and issues warnings
#'  or errors for common problems (e.g., multiple or no suitable subject
#'  columns found, or no valid subject IDs within the chosen column).
#'
#' @param data A dataframe. This dataframe must contain a column that can
#'   be identified as a subject identifier. The function searches for
#'   column names containing "sub" (case-insensitive) to find this
#'   identifier column.
#'
#' @returns
#' A named list with four elements:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{\code{subject_column_name}}{ (Character) The name of the
#'     auto-detected subject identifier column.}
#'   \item{\code{n_rows_for_selected_id}}{ (Numeric) The number of rows
#'     (often corresponding to trials) for the randomly selected subject.}
#'   \item{\code{selected_id_numeric}}{ (Numeric) The ID of the randomly
#'     selected subject, coerced to a numeric type. This may result in
#'     \code{NA} if the original ID cannot be meaningfully converted to a
#'     number (e.g., if IDs are "S01", "P02").}
#'   \item{\code{all_valid_ids}}{ (Vector) A vector containing all unique,
#'     non-NA subject IDs found in the identified subject column. The
#'     type of elements in this vector will match their original type in
#'     the dataframe (e.g., character or numeric).}
